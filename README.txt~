Microsoft's Bing Translator is an API which can do a variety of functions:
1. Translate text between 2 langauges.
2. Detect the native language of given text.
3. Generating and playing a WAV of given text spoken in a chosen dialect

Since the Google Translate API is no more free, it makes sense in using the
Bing Translate API.
The Bing Tranlate API is free for only 2,000,000 Characters/month.

Since the API is by Microsoft, it is bound to be written in C#.
There is also a PHP and Java version of the API.

However, I wanted to use the translator in C/C++ in my Linux system as a part of 
my Speech to Speech Translation project.
I was able to use the Bing translator using JNI in my C++ code and calling 
the functions of the Java API.

In my code, I have only covered the function to Translate text between 2 langauges.

##---------------------------------------------------------------------------------##
Requirements for using the code.
1. Java 1.5 or greater
2. A Windows Azure Marketplace Client ID and Client Secret
Follow first 2 steps of http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh454950.aspx
Store the Client ID and Client Secret.

Source Code:
BingTranslator.h
BingTranslator.cc --> contains all the necessary C++ functions. 
example.cc --> Shows a demo example.
folder com and jason --> The Java source code for Bing API
TranslateExample.class and TranslateExample.java--> Java functions used by my C++ code

I have included the JAVA APIs in my file. You can download them
separately from
https://code.google.com/p/microsoft-translator-java-api/downloads/list

##--------------------------------------------------------------------------------##

Before using the code->
Export the Java JVM libraries

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/default-java/jre/lib/amd64/:/usr/lib/jvm/default-java/jre/lib/amd64/server/;

Generally, this is the common path where the JRE libraries will be stored.
In case they are stored at a different location, do the appropriate changes.

You can add this line to the end of the ~/.bashrc file as well.

Compiling the file
------------------

g++ -g demoExample.cc BingTranslator.cc -I /usr/lib/jvm/default-java/include/ -I /usr/lib/jvm/default-java/include/linux/ -L /usr/lib/jvm/default-java/jre/lib/amd64/ -L /usr/lib/jvm/default-java/jre/lib/amd64/server/ -ljvm -o demoExample

In place of example.cc, you can have your own C++ files. 
Include the file "BingTranslator.h" in your source code and follow the syntax used in demoExample.cc.

Run the file
-----------------
./demoExample
